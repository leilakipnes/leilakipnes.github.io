My GitHub account was newly created for CTI-110 as a way to organize future assignments.
I created an original repository and then cloned it by clicking on the clone repository option, selecting my previously made repository, and opting to put into a GitHub folder outside of my CTI-110 folder in my windows file system. I then edited the information in my README to include my name and email and a description of both my github and the changes I've made to this repository.
